 Neural Style Transfer with TensorFlow (VGG19)
This project implements Neural Style Transfer (NST) using TensorFlow and the pre-trained VGG19 model. NST blends the content of one image with the style of another to generate a new, stylized image. This technique was popularized by the paper “A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style” by Gatys et al.
