 Neural Style Transfer with TensorFlow (VGG19)
This project implements Neural Style Transfer (NST) using TensorFlow and the pre-trained VGG19 model. NST blends the content of one image with the style of another to generate a new, stylized image. This technique was popularized by the paper “A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style” by Gatys et al.

How It Works
Load images: The content and style images are loaded and resized to a maximum dimension.
Extract features: The pre-trained VGG19 model is used to extract feature maps from specific layers.
Compute Gram matrix: Style representation is computed using the Gram matrix of selected layers.
Optimize: A generated image is initialized as a copy of the content image and optimized to match the style and content targets using gradient descent.
Display & Save: Stylized images are displayed after each epoch and saved to the output folder.


Requirements
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
PIL
IPython (for image display)
(Optional) Jupyter/Kaggle Notebook environment

Parameters You Can Customize:
epochs: Number of times the optimization loop runs.
steps_per_epoch: Number of optimization steps per epoch.
style_weight: Weight for how much style influences the final image.
content_weight: Weight for how much content is retained.
total_variation_weight: Weight for smoothness.

Here are some potential improvements and extensions to this project:

Batch Stylization
Extend the script to stylize a batch of content images using one or more style images.
Style Interpolation
Combine multiple styles into a single output (e.g., Van Gogh + Monet).
GAN-based Style Transfer
Integrate advanced methods like CycleGAN or StyleGAN for real-time and photorealistic results.
Interactive Web UI
Build a frontend using Flask/Gradio/Streamlit so users can upload images and select styles.
Video Style Transfer
Extend to videos using optical flow to maintain temporal consistency.
Mobile Deployment
Convert the model using TensorFlow Lite to enable stylization on mobile devices.
Use Custom CNNs
Try other architectures like ResNet or MobileNet for faster or more abstract transformations.
